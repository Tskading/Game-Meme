# Game & Gif
Game & Gif is a website for when you just get away from the stress of the daily grind.  We aren't here to change your life, we are here to supplement your downtime, and give a one stop page that allows you to explore the online world of games and gifs!  

## User Story
AS A gamer
I WANT to view a database of games that I can explore on my downtime while also being entertained
SO THAT I can gain information and plug myself into a gaming community

# How to Use Our Site

Simply type in the game you want to search for in the search bar and we will get you a screenshot and some basic information on the game, courtesy of the RAWG API.  You can also click the title of the game in the right card to go to a youTube video based on your search - what video does your favorite game pull up?  On our desktop version, you have access to six different links to keep you plugged into the gaming and gif online world - from news to streams to stores to reddit, we have you covered.  Also, did you know you weren't using your prime membersip to its fullest - we have a link to all of the games made available for free through this service!  On the bottom of our page we display five gifs, sourced with the GIPHY API, based on your search.  If you like one, just right-click and go to the giphy page and see what else you can find.
