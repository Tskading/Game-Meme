# ðŸŽ® Game & Gif ðŸŽ®
Game & Gif is a website for when you just get away from the stress of the daily grind.  We aren't here to change your life, we are here to supplement your downtime, and give a one stop page that allows you to explore the online world of games and gifs! ðŸŽ®

Simply type in the game you want to search for in the search bar and we will get you customized links, five gifs, a screenshot, a video-link and some basic information on the game. All this courtesy of the RAWG API and the Giphy API.  You can also click the title of the game to go to a top youTube video based on your search - what video does your favorite game pull up?  You have access to six different links to keep you plugged into the gaming and gif online world - from news (Polygon) to streams (Twitch) to stores (Amazon) to reddit (r/gaming), we have you covered.  Everytime you search with us, we load up your links with custom searches on different gaming communities around the web.  You will know you succeded, because your custom links will all now glow blue.

On the bottom of our page we display five gifs, sourced with the GIPHY API, again, based on your search.  If you like one, just right-click and go to the giphy page and see what else you can find.  

Also, did you know you weren't using your prime membersip to its fullest - we have a link to all of the games made available for free through this service!
